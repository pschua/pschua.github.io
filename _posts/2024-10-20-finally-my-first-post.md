# Hello World
I've been wanting to kill my previous website that's built on Django cause it was too out-of-date and doesn't reflect my needs anymore.

It's a hassle to maintain, especially cause it's a total from-zero built with no starter template or well-written documentation on how to maintain thanks to its lazy developer.

It's also another avenue for cost cutting in this cost-cutting era.

I'm glad killing it was easy, and I backed up all the posts, although I don't plan to repost those old stuff.

Many of those are outdated, and probably some LLMs already gobbled the knowledge up.

Not sure what I'm gonna do with this yet, but just keeping it here for now.

# Hello World
I've been wanting to kill my previous website that's built on Django cause it was too out-of-date and doesn't reflect my needs anymore.

Also I just want to save money.

I'm glad killing it was easy and I managed to back up all the posts, though I don't plan to repost those old stuff.

Not sure what I'm gonna do with this yet, but just keeping it here for now.
